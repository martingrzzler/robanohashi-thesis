\section{Body} \label{sec:body}


The body of your thesis usually consists of a sequence of sections and sunsections that tell the story of your problem, approach and results. 

We're using this section to exemplify some of the conventions you should follow for integrating figures, references etc.

\input{sections/chapters/motivation}
\input{sections/chapters/state-of-the-art}
\input{sections/chapters/relevant_features}
\input{sections/chapters/evaluation_data}
\input{sections/chapters/feature-evaluation}

\subsection{Footnotes and References} \label{sec:body_refs}

References to external work are your way provide additional information to the reader.

Footnotes are used for any information that isn't crucial for the text but could be used by a more interested reader to get more information \footnote{It's a good idea to keep them short and to the point}. They may also contain links \footnote{e.g., to \url{http://isitfriday.org}}.

References are your way to refer to existing scientific work. They shouldn't be limited to the state of the art section. They can be used whenever you want to establish a fact that has already been published or if you want to point the reader to a place where they can find additional information.
Throughout your thesis you should include keys to the respective publications right after you use content from them. For example, this would look like this: \cite{greenwade93} \cite{einstein} .
